# Introduction


**At the end of this chapter you should be able to **

-   understand the structure and utlility of `teal` apps
-   understand the utility of `teal` apps
-   determine whether `teal` apps are useful for *you*

## Structure of teal apps

teal is a shiny-based modular framework. It provides an interactive user interface allowing users to customize tables and visualizations facilitating the exploration and analysis of clinical trial data. Dynamic analysis and display control, data filtering and code reproducibility are included in each module.

teal modules are laid out in three panels.

-   The `Left Panel`, referred to as the encoding panel, includes elements used to adjust the output interactively.

-   The `Center Panel`, referred to as the output panel, where the tables and visualizations are displayed.

-   The `Right Panel`, referred to as the data filter panel, includes elements used to subset the data interactively.

The layout is pre-set within each module. However, user can decide overall tab order and nesting. See @fig-layout for the typical teal app structure.

### Modules

`teal` modules are modular building blocks for your `teal` app. They implement specific app functionalities, such as outlier exploration, data visualizations, and survival analysis. Although modules can be created from scratch, many `teal` modules have already been released and can be found in the following packages:

-   `teal.modules.general`: general modules for exploring relational/independent/CDISC data

-   `teal.modules.clinical`: modules specific to CDISC data and clinical trial reporting

-   `teal.modules.hermes`: modules for analyzing [MultiAssayExperiment objects](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiAssayExperiment.html)

are shiny modules built within the teal framework that specify analysis to be performed.
