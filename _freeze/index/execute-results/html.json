We expect you to already have some R experience and that you know what you want to achieve with the application. You do not need to know how to create a shiny application. The `teal` package aims to make the creation of (teal-specific) shiny applications relatively intuitive without the need to understand how shiny works exactly. Shiny knowledge is useful once you want to either modify an application, or write your own teal module from scratch.\n\n## What will you learn\n\n## How is it structured\n\nAll chapters in this book follow a common structure: First, the learning goals of a chapter is defined. We then go through the step-by-step process of using specific `teal` modules. In each chapter we combine what we learned into one code chunk with which we can create a functional teal application. As every `teal` app requires data, the app created in the introduction will be the fundamental building block of the apps in the subsequent chapters. In the *toy apps* created in each chapter you should be able to understand every line of code. The code for a more developed app (but built for the same purpose) and a deployed instance of that app is linked at the end of each chapter. What you learned in this chapter should give you a good understanding of how the more developed application works.\n\n## Where can you find more\n\n<!-- This is a collection of materials used for the introductory content of teal found on the [pharmaverse youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@pharmaverse6572). -->\n",
